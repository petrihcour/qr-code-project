## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### Continued development

I am still learning and getting comfortable with HTMl and CSS. Completing more projects like this and learning from the mistakes I have made will help me. I will focus on ensuring I don't take for granted all the different elements in HTML. There was an instance where the `<body>` and the `<main>` were non-existent, making it difficult for me to handle my `<footer>`.
